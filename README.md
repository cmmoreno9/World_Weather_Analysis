# World Weather Analysis

## Description
Jack and the Betatesters are enjoying the app, however, they have some more recommendations. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data. Additionally, the beta testers want to input their statments to filter data to their specific weather preferences. This information will then be used to identify potential travel destinatino and nearby hotels. From there, the user will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary, and travel routes. 

## The project was broken up into three deliverables: 
  Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
  
  Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
  
  Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map
